## Overview
For this project I was to refractor Horiseon Company's code making it neat with semantics as well as condensing unecessary css classes. The project was to ensure none of the code or the overall site was changed but just re-done to create an easier, more efficient html and css for the company to go back to and work on if need be. 

To start, I changed all of the divs to semantics. This includes: Header, Footer, Aside, Main, Section, Nav, etc. I then changed the associated element names in CSS if need be. I added notes to both html and css to show the company where I made some changes to their files. Their site is unchanged like the company had asked but the code is refractored for their benefit.
